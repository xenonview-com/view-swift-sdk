# Development Environment

## Dependencies

* swift (provided by xcode application)
* [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) 

## Installing library dependencies

Before development, you'll need to install development dependencies by running:

```bash
swift build
```

## Running tests

You can run the tests for the whole project in the root directory by simply running:

```bash
swift test
```

Or by test
```bash
swift test --filter"test_name"
```

The following sections show how to run testing variants during development.

### Coverage

To run the tests in "coverage mode" (runs all tests then calculates coverage for each dir/file):
```bash
./coverage_report
# --- OR ---
./coverage_html
# --- OR ---
swift test --enable-code-coverage
xcrun llvm-cov report   --ignore-filename-regex='(.build|Tests)[/\\].*'   -instr-profile $(swift test --show-codecov-path | xargs dirname)/default.profdata $(find .build/debug/xenon_view_sdk.build -name '*.o' -print0 | xargs -0 printf '%s ')
```

# Publishing

_We (package maintainers) handle this step so this is more of internal notes:_

To publish the package make a new git tag with the semantic version:
```bash
git tag -a v0.0.0 -m "0.0.0 <change summary>"
```
Additionally create a GitHub release from the tag.
