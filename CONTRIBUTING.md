# Development Environment

## Dependencies

* yarn
* chromedriver


## Installing library dependencies

Before development, you'll need to install development dependencies (npm packages) by running:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running tests

You can run the tests for the whole project in the root directory by simply running:

```bash
yarn test
```

The following sections show how to run testing variants during development.

### Watch

To run the tests in "watch mode" (runs any tests touched by unstaged Git changes and re-runs tests when files change):
```bash
yarn test:watch
```

### Coverage

To run the tests in "coverage mode" (runs all tests then calculates coverage for each dir/file):
```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

# Publishing

_We (package maintainers) handle this step so this is more of internal notes:_

To publish the package (we use ```np```, for help go [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np)):

```shell
yarn release
```
